Hello! <br> I'm [João](https://jfaria.carrd.co), an aspiring astrophysicist,
sailing the turbulent waters of academia.

<!-- </p> -->
I decided to write a blog because it's a good way to procrastinate.
Well, that too, but mainly I'm struggling with journal articles
being the minimum publishing unit for my work.
Therefore, the _academic_ is about work in progress,
small enough pieces of research 
that didn't make it (at least yet) to a paper.
In the meanwhile, I'll also write about whatever happens every day.



Have questions or suggestions? 
Feel free to [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/astroaware)
or by [email](mailto:joao.faria@astro.up.pt). <br>
Thanks for reading!
