### Some brief biographic notes


I was born in Santarém, a small town in the center of Portugal.
The reason I was born there is because there was no maternity 
in the even smaller town of Alpiarça, where I'm *actually* from.
Decades later, I still love that place, with endless horizons, 
[cute horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorraia), and nice people.

At a young age, I moved to Lisbon, where I went to school and learned to be a
person.

<!-- I am now a researcher in the Institute of Astrophysics and Space Sciences 
(see [here](http://www.iastro.pt)).  -->
School, school, and then more school as I finished my Bachelor degree in
Physics at the University of Lisbon, in 2011, after which I moved North (just by
300km, Portugal is small) and got my MSc and PhD degrees in Astronomy, at the
University of Porto.

For my Masters thesis, I worked on asteroseismology of the 16 Cyg binary pair.
My supervisors were very nice so I managed to learn *a lot* during this time.
The PhD was next; my new supervisors were also very nice, so
[that](http://astro.up.pt/~jfaria/phd/) came to life, which I'm quite proud of.
Then, and ever since, I've been dealing with everything related to stellar
radial velocities: how to measure them and analyse them precisely
([here's how]({{site.baseurl}}/research)).  

I'm always looking forward to learning something new, I have detected my share
of extra-solar planets, and I like to think like a Bayesian when doing data
analysis. Right now I'm involved in the planet search and the analysis of data
from the ESPRESSO high-precision spectrograph. Believe me, ESPRESSO is
absolutely amazing! Besides that, I really like to write code for both 
[fun](https://github.com/j-faria/copy-paste-matplotlib-figures) and
[profit](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00487).
