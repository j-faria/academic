*You should never bin your data*, you hear people saying.  
But what if you really really want to?


## let's bin!

First, we create fake sinusoidal data

```python
import numpy as np

t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
y = 5*np.sin(t) + np.random.randn(t.size)
```

which we now want to bin in bins of 0.5.

```python
width = 0.5
bins = np.arange(t.min(), t.max()+width, width)
```

`scipy` has a handy function for this:

```python
from scipy.stats import binned_statistic
```

which can be used as 

```python
binned_y = binned_statistic(t, y, bins=bins)[0]
```


Let's plot the result

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(t, y, alpha=0.5)
plt.plot(bins[1:] - width/2.,  binned_y, 'o-')
```

## more options

By default, `binned_statistic` calculates the *mean* of the data inside each bin.
But we can calculate other statistics, as explained in the 
[documentation](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.binned_statistic.html).  
The `statistic` optional argument can be:

```
statistic : string or callable, optional
    The statistic to compute (default is 'mean'). The following statistics are available:
        'mean'   : compute the mean of values for points within each bin.
        'median' : compute the median of values for points within each bin.
        'count'  : compute the count of points within each bin. 
                   This is identical to an unweighted histogram.
        'sum'    : compute the sum of values for points within each bin. 
                   This is identical to a weighted histogram.
        'min'    : compute the minimum of values for points within each bin.
        'max'    : compute the maximum of values for point within each bin.
        function : a user-defined function which takes a 1D array of values, 
                   and outputs a single numerical statistic. 
                   This function will be called on the values in each bin. 
                   Empty bins will be represented by function([]), or NaN if this returns an error.
```


## wrap-up 

That's it, a simple handy function to bin data!
