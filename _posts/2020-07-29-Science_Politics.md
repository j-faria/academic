> There are important differences between Science and Politics.  
> One searches for truth, the other for power.  
> One is interested in causes, the other in solutions.  
> One strives for thoroughness, the other for efficiency.  
> One measures quality based on validity, the other on public acceptance.  
> As such, the relation between the two is not without friction.
