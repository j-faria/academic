After arriving in Paranal close to 1am, I had a good night sleep in the Residencia.
When I woke up and looked out the window, this was the view

The morning was calm, and we are now getting ready to go up the mountain
to start planning the next commissioning nights.
Lots of people are here, and there's a bunch of things to do
(I guess, I still don't know what there actually is to do).  
So, 1:30 pm, off we go!
