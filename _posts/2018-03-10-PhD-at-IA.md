Dear Prospective PhD Candidate,

The Ph.D. Programme in Astronomy at the University of Porto ([www.up.pt](www.up.pt))
will be accepting applications for the academic year of 2018/2019 
from the **2nd of April to the 22nd of May** (2nd phase). 
This is an international programme 
(all components of the programme are in English and there are external invited lectures), with a curricular component equivalent to half of the first year (30 ECTS) 
and a component of training by research for 2.5 years (150 ECTS).

The student may pursue a research project in any topic of Astronomy & Astrophysics, 
to be hosted in a research institute in Portugal or abroad.
Co-supervisions by experts in international organizations (ESO and ESA),
where Portugal is a member state, are encouraged. For a list of ongoing and
finished projects please visit [this page](http://www.fc.up.pt/dfa/astro/pda/thesis/).

The **deadline for applications** for the current academic year for the
Phase 2 call (this is the second call for the 2018/2019 academic year) 
is the **22nd of May 2018**.

The submission of the application for registration in this call must be done
online (will open on the 2nd of April) at
[this page](https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/en/CAND_GERAL.CONCURSOS_CAND_ABERTOS_VIEW?pv_curso_id=881).

For further information and inquires about this PhD Programme,
please visit [this page](http://www.fc.up.pt/dfa/astro/pda/).
The 2018/2019 academic year for this programme will start on the 12th of October 2018.

Registration in the Program does not provide funding and requires payment of
tuition and registration fees. If candidates require financial support, it must
be obtained through specific calls for funding Ph.D. and/or research fellowships.

This Ph.D. Degree has been part of the Doctoral Network in Space Sciences
([PhD::SPACE](http://phd-space.iastro.pt)), 
a joint initiative by IA, that has been funded in the Call for FCT PhD Programs.

I am looking forward to welcoming you in Porto,
