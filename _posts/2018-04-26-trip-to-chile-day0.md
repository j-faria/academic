I'm writing this post from the ESO guest house in Santiago, Chile,
after a loooong flight over the Atlantic. 
Later this afternoon I will take a plane to Antofagasta, 
and then a bus to the Paranal observatory.
We are here for the commissioning of ESPRESSO,
the new high-resolution spectrograph installed in ESO's VLT.

I had been to Chile before, to observe with HARPS in La Silla.
But I have no idea what it will be like to observe during the commissioning
of a new instrument, and I have never been to ESO's largest observatory, Paranal.

The goal is to document the journey in this series of posts.
Stay tuned!
